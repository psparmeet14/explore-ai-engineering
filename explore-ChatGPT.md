### Making the most of ChatGPT

1. From one-line thought to a well prepared plan:

**Prompt**: Iâ€™m running a 30-minute knowledge-sharing session on [topic]. Create an agenda with timed sections, key talking points, and 3 interactive questions.

For variety, ask ChatGPT: "Give me 2 completely different versions of this plan"

2. Re-Writing

**Prompt**: Rewrite this in a clear, friendly, professional tone. Give me 2 versions. 

For keeping it concise, ask ChatGPT: "Make this shorter but keep the impact"
